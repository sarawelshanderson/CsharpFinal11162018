Code Louisville Final Project Fall 2018 C# Csharp

I found datasets for Food Inspections for the State of Kentucky online https://catalog.data.gov .  From this dataset I created a very basic CRUD app for web browser that displays data, enables the user to add, delete and edit.

Requires the following packages:

- EntityFramework.6.2.0
- Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.5.2.6
- Microsoft.AspNet.Razor.3.2.3
- Microsoft.AspNet.WebPages.3.2.3
- Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform.2.0.0
- Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure.1.0.0.0

Clone Repository in Visual studio.  May need to connect tot he Data Source Press F5 to build.  This will open web browser for application to run.
Application opens with index page.
Click on Locations at top of page to experience CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete.

Future commits would include:
- search function
- constraints and formatting checks on textboxes
- replace some textboxes with pre-populated Dropdowns
- LocationView as a grid format
